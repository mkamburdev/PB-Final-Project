This repository was created for a project at the Digital Career Institute (DCI). It contains all the code for a Pomodoro Timer application, written in JavaScript.

The project is the result of a few days of work and demonstrates the skills I acquired during my time at DCI when dealing with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The application has a simple and intuitive design that looks good on all devices. It allows users to switch between different timer durations and to start, pause, and reset the timer.
